**Uno Zen** is a fork of [Uno for Ghost](https://github.com/daleanthony/Uno) that provides some features missing in the original theme:

* Some little improves in the layout grid and in the CSS style.
* Search support by [ghostHunter](https://github.com/i11ume/ghostHunter/).
* Main post image support.
* Better development and production with Grunt.

... and more and more features in the future. If you want to help visit TODO section.
